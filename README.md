# Classic Machine Learning

This repository is where I document my journey of learning, experimenting, and applying machine learning techniques to real-world datasets. It's less of a polished product and more of a place to track my growth, explore new ideas, and build a portfolio of hands-on projects.

## Notebooks:
1) ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçü©π**Predicting Heart Failure** - Classic ML, Binary classification (2025)
   
     Goal: Predict the likelihood of heart failure using clinical patient data.
     Classic machine learning methods explored in SciKitLearn with explanations of Pros, Cons and common parameters.
   

## Reports:
1) üéÑüëï**Finding festivity in knitwear** - CNNs for image classification (2023)
   
   This report aims to train an image classification model to classify Christmas jumpers from everyday knitwear. Models explored include CNNs trained from scratch with a range of depths and pre-trained CNNs: AlexNet, VGG and GoogLeNet. To reduce overfitting, all models were run on a greyscale version of the dataset, with success. The final model was a fine-tuned version of the GoogLeNet architecture, achieving an accuracy of 93.67%. Exploring the misclassified examples exposed flaws in the dataset and suggests that this accuracy can be expected to change significantly when tested with a more robust dataset.
